# Make-a-joke
This was originally designed and implemented over the summer of 2022, however as it was created over a short period in a game jam type environment and I was learning as I went I carelessly didn't create a github repository for it. This means I don't have a commit history and everything will be one large commit.

There is a reocurring issue of lack of commentation. I hope to go back to this project at a later stage to fix up the code, however it's unlikely.

For further note, a theme is something called a stoke or a stord. I initially thought it would be funny to call a stored joke object a stoke, due to it potentially stoking a flame. This was not very funny but it did stick (not stored -ick), meaning every stored object got called a st (word). Stord is stored word and stokedao is applied to both Stords and stokes.

When a developer goes back to this project please take note to improve the menu page, I was researching better ways to represent it and there's a way to add multiple colours and design to the background, improving that would make the design significantly better. The buttons are flat and plain right now but there's also another method to improve that.
I've left creative liberty in what to add to the admin page of settings, I made adding a word an admin setting as I didn't want someone grabbing my phone and just adding a swear word. 
The admin password is admin.
I would modify the task list for this Github but I don't have much time.

The name of the app on the phone is still my - application I forgot to change it.

Something major that could be done is adding networking and a server with stored jokes. I didn't have enough time in the jam for that so it's a bane in my side, I made each word have a unique ID so we can implement that in future. The app is really hard to use if it's just local. If you had it be a multi-person thing i could really see this expanding, it's unfortunate.
